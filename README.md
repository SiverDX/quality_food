# General
This mod adds quality to food and certain food-related material (e.g. crops) through NBT data (meaning no new items)

Quality can:
- Increase nutrition and saturation
- Improve positive effects and diminish (or outright remove) negative effects gained from eating food
- Impact the result of crafted (quality applicable) items (the `minecraft:generic.luck` attribute increases the chance as well)

---

You can give yourself a quality item like this: `/give @s farmersdelight:roast_chicken_block{quality_food:{quality:2}}`
- `quality` is a value between `0` (`NONE`) and `3` (`DIAMOND`)
- Setting `NONE` does not make sense since it will not affect anything and just makes the item unstackable with non-quality items

You can also use the following commands 
- `/quality_food give`
- `/quality_food apply`
- `/quality_food remove`

# Configuration
There is a configuration per quality - aside from some normal things you can also specify which item should gain which effects
- Example: `effect_list = ["minecraft:apple;minecraft:regeneration;0.5;120;3;0.45"]`
  - `minecraft:apple` is the item this effect should apply to (can also be a tag, e.g. `#minecraft:cat_food`)
  - `minecraft:regeneration` is the effect
  - `0.5` is the chance for a food item to gain this effect (`1` means 100%)
  - `120` is the duration in ticks (`20` ticks means 1 second)
  - `3` is the amplifier (`0` results in an effect level of 1 (i.e. no level shown))
  - `0.45` is the probability to gain this effect when eating the item (`1` means 100%)

The tag of an item with effects applied to it looks like this:
```json
{
  quality_food: {
    effects: [
      {
        "forge:id": "minecraft:regeneration", 
        chance: 0.45d, 
        Ambient: 0b, 
        CurativeItems: [
          {
            id: "minecraft:milk_bucket", 
            Count: 1b
          }
        ], 
        ShowIcon: 1b, 
        ShowParticles: 1b, 
        Duration: 120, 
        Id: 10, 
        Amplifier: 3b
      }
    ], 
    quality: 1
  }
}
```

I don't recommend manually creating such items - the `quality_food` commands will apply the configured effects

---

There is a farmland configuration which allows you to define a bonus (can also be negative, i.e. 0.5) based on the farm block the crop is planted on
- Example: `farmland_config = ["3;#minecraft:crops;farmersdelight:rich_soil_farmland;1.25"]`
  - `3` is the index (configurations are tested with the lowest one first - the first matching one will be applied) (needs to be positive)
  - `#minecraft:crops` is the crop block (can be a tag or a single block)
  - `farmersdelight:rich_soil_farmland` is the farmland block (can be a tag or a single block)
  - `1.25` is the multiplier to be applied (needs to be positive - values below `1` will reduce the chance)

---

Non-food items can be made applicable to quality by adding them to the `quality_food:material_whitelist` item tag

---

For crafting (crafting table) there are three configs:
- `retain_quality_recipes`: The result will retain the quality of the ingredients, examples:
  - If all items are `diamond` quality the result will be `diamond`
  - If three items are `gold` quality and two are `diamond` the result will be `gold`
  - If two items are `iron` quality and the rest have none then the result will also have none
- `no_quality_recipes`: Entries will not roll for quality (useful in case items can be crated back and forth)
- `handle_compacting`: If enabled then (de)compacting results should retain quality automatically without having to specify the relevant recipes

Cooking quality items will store a quality bonus within the furnace / cooking pot / ...
- Higher quality will store a higher bonus per cooked item
- Once enough bonus is stored particles will start to show
  - A higher bonus results in more particles
  - This can be disabled through the client config
- Once you take out the result the stored bonus will be used up and grant a higher chance to a quality result

For compatibilityâ€™s sake certain blocks (and their item variant) are supported in a broader way than needed 

If you find some items having quality where it doesn't make much sense you can blacklist them using the item tag `quality_food:blacklist`

- Items should generally be fine
