- proper farmland handling for crop growing in height (e.g. rice)
- (milk) buckets with quality hold more liquid / have more uses?

block state is loaded before quality types are present -> ?
- keep block quality in own map?
- in setblock if new block is a non quality block then remove from map
- otherwise in setblock query the quality from world data?
